Spring vs. Spring Boot
Overview

Spring Framework is a comprehensive framework for building Java applications. It provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications, enabling developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code.

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications. It provides a convention-over-configuration approach, reducing the amount of boilerplate code and configuration required.

Key Differences

1. Setup and Configuration
    Spring Framework: Requires extensive configuration, often involving XML and Java-based configuration files. Setting up a Spring application involves configuring beans, managing dependencies, and setting up the environment.
    Spring Boot: Uses convention-over-configuration, offering a variety of starter projects to get up and running quickly. It auto-configures many aspects of the application based on the dependencies present in the classpath, minimizing manual setup.

2. Embedded Server
    Spring Framework: Requires an external server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) to run the application. You must deploy your application to the server manually.
    Spring Boot: Comes with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, allowing you to run applications as standalone Java applications. This simplifies development and deployment.

3. Dependencies Management
    Spring Framework: Developers manually manage dependencies and configurations for various Spring projects (e.g., Spring MVC, Spring Security).
    Spring Boot: Provides starter dependencies (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa) that bundle common dependencies for specific use cases, simplifying dependency management.

4. Opinionated Defaults
    Spring Framework: Requires explicit configuration for most components and services, giving developers complete control over the setup.
    Spring Boot: Offers opinionated defaults and auto-configuration to streamline development. These defaults can be overridden if needed, but they provide a sensible starting point.

5. Production-Ready Features
    Spring Framework: Does not include production-ready features out-of-the-box.
    Spring Boot: Includes production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration support. The spring-boot-actuator module provides various endpoints to monitor and manage the application.

6. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
    Spring Framework: No CLI support for managing the application lifecycle.
    Spring Boot: Offers a CLI tool that allows developers to quickly prototype and run Spring applications using Groovy scripts.

Use Cases

Spring Framework: Ideal for large, complex applications where fine-grained control over configuration is necessary. It is suitable for legacy projects or applications with specific, customized requirements.

Spring Boot: Best for new projects and microservices where rapid development and minimal configuration are prioritized. It is also suitable for deploying standalone applications or creating RESTful services quickly.

Conclusion

Spring Framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, offering maximum flexibility and control. However, it requires more manual configuration and setup.

Spring Boot builds on top of the Spring Framework, simplifying the development process with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and sensible defaults. It is designed to get applications up and running quickly with minimal effort.

Choosing between Spring and Spring Boot depends on the project requirements. For new projects, microservices, or when rapid development is a priority, Spring Boot is usually the preferred choice. For existing projects or applications needing extensive customization and configuration, the Spring Framework may be more appropriate.
