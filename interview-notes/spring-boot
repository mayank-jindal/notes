In Spring Framework, @Controller and @RestController are both used to define controller classes, but they serve different purposes:

@Controller
Purpose:
    Used to define a standard web controller that handles requests and returns views (HTML pages).
Response:
    Typically returns a ModelAndView object or a view name. It often works with templates (like Thymeleaf, JSP).
Usage:
    Commonly used in applications that follow the MVC pattern where views are rendered on the server side.

@RestController
Purpose:
    A specialized version of @Controller that is used for RESTful web services.
Response:
    Automatically serializes return objects to JSON or XML (using @ResponseBody behind the scenes). It does not return view names.
Usage:
    Ideal for APIs where the response is usually in JSON format and you want to expose data without rendering views.
